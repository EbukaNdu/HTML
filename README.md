For this challenge:

Part one, we used Splinter to automate browsing and Beautiful Soup to scrape the Mars news site.
The HTML code along with Titles and preview text of news articles were scraped and extracted successfully, stored in a list of dictionaries
with each dictionary containing two keys: 'title' and 'preview', representing the title and preview text of a news article, respectively.
The list of dictionaries was printed to confirm successful scraping.


Part two, the dataset contains information about Martian temperatures and pressures over a period of time.
It includes columns such as 'id', 'terrestrial_date', 'sol', 'ls', 'month', 'min_temp', and 'pressure'.
The data spans across multiple months on Mars, with counts ranging from 112 to 194 observations per month.
Based on the dataset, the number of terrestrial (earth) days in a Martian year is 1867 days.
The average low temperatures vary across different months, ranging from around -83.307292°C in March (the coldest month) to around -68.382979°C in August (the warmest month).
The average pressure also fluctuates throughout the Martian months, indicating potential seasonal variations.
The dataset seems to be well-structured and free from major inconsistencies However, further analysis and validation may be required depending on the specific research or application.
The analyzed data has been exported to a CSV file named "mars_weather.csv" for further reference and analysis.
